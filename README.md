# tsal-sorting
Some sorting algorithms for TSAL.
Mostly just from the examples from the TSAL repo but with modified problem sizes and without parallelization.
You can make them with `make`.

By default, the programs run without audio, just analyzing time.
To run with audio, run the program with `-a`.
